        <h2>Letter of Introduction</h2>
        <p>Dear Recruiter,</p>
        <p>I am extremely excited to have the opportunity to apply for the summer analyst program with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. While doing research into financial institutions I could potentially call home upon graduation I was repeatedly drawn to the J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. website. I really enjoy the company’s commitment to diversity and inclusion not just as a one-off propaganda slogan but as a core belief and attribute. I received a recruitment email from Fernanda Mancilla which included information about the Corporate & Investment Bank Advancing Black Pathways Insights Program. Receiving that email acknowledging, celebrating, and encouraging minority representation in banking led me to further investigate and discover J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.’s commitment to operational excellence, integrity, the environment, and community building; all causes I care deeply about. I believe that my alignment with company values, my skills, and my work ethic, are all reasons why I will be a good fit and succeed as a summer analyst with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.</p>
        <p>As a triple major (business analytics, economics, finance) with a minor in information technology, working towards a Bachelor of Business Administration degree, I have fine-tuned the virtues of self-discipline and multitasking. Scheduling and meeting deadlines are skills I have had to learn, but once I learned them, I mastered them. During my studies I have, on multiple occasions, produced multiple high-quality deliverables in tandem. The business classes that I have taken so far have prepared me for some of the tasks I may be performing such as reading and interpreting financial reports and constructing data driven research presentations. They have also helped me understand the importance of collaboration and teamwork in the professional world. </p>
        <p>On the other hand, my current career as a full-time retail manager has given me the chance to cultivate strong verbal and written communication skills. Along with communication, I have had to hone my analytical skills and become a problem solver. Every day is a new puzzle that must be decoded in order to succeed. I routinely lead a team of over thirty associates to meet our benchmarks. My exceptional metrics have enabled me to be promoted multiple times in my career. My attention to detail and willingness to communicate have often landed me in leadership roles in both my professional and academic life. Through the obstacles of a demanding career and full-time studies I have managed to maintain a 3.83 GPA and earn a spot on my university’s chancellor’s list the last two semesters. These academic and professional successes show that I am capable of managing the workload associated with high level banking activities while continuing my streak of delivering exceptional and timely results. </p>
        <p>As a result of the skills I have gained from my professional and academic endeavors, I am prepared for the challenges and rewards that come with a summer analyst position with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. My work ethic, collaborative spirit, and self-determination are all attributes that I have confidence will allow me to be an asset to the team at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Thank you for your attention and consideration. I hope to hear from you soon.</p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>

From the presentation the class was asked to determine what, if any, ethical standards were breached and how the outcome could have been different had those standards been upheald.</p>
