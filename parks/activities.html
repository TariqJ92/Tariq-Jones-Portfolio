      <h3>Beach</h3>
      <p>A favorite of park guests and locals alike is the sand beach of DeGray Lake Resort State Park located at the Caddo Bend day use area. Open from 8:00am to one hour after sunset daily, Caddo Bend is the ideal location for a recreational day on the lake.
      </p>
      <p>The sand beach is perfect for family outings. There is a designated swimming area off limits to personal watercraft and boats. Picnic tables are scattered under the tree canopies throughout Caddo Bend and offer a respite from the sun as well as fitting locations for everyone to gather away from the water.</p>
      <p>Caddo Bend has ample parking and also provides restrooms and a playground. Note: There is no lifeguard on duty.</p>
      <h3>Marina</h3>
      <p>Completed by the Corp of Engineers in 1972, DeGray Lake is a 13,800-acre fishing and water sports paradise. This sparkling lake on the Caddo River offers Arkansas’s finest fishing for hybrid striped bass and great angling for walleye, crappie, bream and catfish. In warm months the lake waters are ideal for water-skiing, sailing, snorkeling, kayaking, pleasure boating and other popular lake activities. The clear water of DeGray Lake is also perfect for scuba diving and swimming.</p>
      <p>DeGray Lake Resort State Park offers a full-service marina complete with dock space, watercraft rentals, fuel station and a bait & tackle shop. Drinks and snacks are also available. A wide variety of boat rentals are available, including flat bottom boats with motors, deck boats, party barges, kayaks, pedal boats and canoes.

        <h2>Trails</h2>
      </header>
      <p>DeGray Lake Resort State Park has six trails for guests to enjoy alone or on a scheduled, park interpreter guided hike. Each of DeGray’s trails takes you into a unique area of the park. In order to preserve the beauty of the park and its trails, bicycles and motorized vehicles are not permitted on the trails. Please protect DeGray’s environment by leaving plants, rocks and wildlife alone as well as helping to keep the trails clean of litter.</p>
      <p>We also have the Islets Cove Paddle Trail. Nestled along DeGray Lake’s north shore adjacent to the state park, this three-mile loop trail leads paddlers in and out of tranquil coves and along forested shores that support an abundance of flora and fauna, offering excellent wildlife viewing opportunities.  Trail accessibility is determined by lake level, which is typically ideal between January-July.</p>
